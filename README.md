# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a game where you can draw on a grid pad. You can change the color of your pen and the size of the grid. 

I love sending my project out to my friends and family for them to play with, but I will need to learn the touch events for mobile and tablet first. I will come back and try to make it look as nice and functional as possible on smaller screens.

## Features
- Grid size can change from 16 * 16 to 80 * 80
- Color picker available
- Provide random seasonal colors palette
- Eraser for painted grid
- Button for clearing the board 

## What I Learned
- Creating multiple elements and append them the page 
- Connecting mouse events to elements created by JavaScript
- Using HTML’s input type “range” to change the amount of the grids
- Resetting the board by removing all of the children elements using “while” loop
- Generating random colors from assigned arrays’ values
- Changing the color of the pen by using “onClick” event on HTML
- Activating the “mouseenter” event only by switching Boolean value (click)
- Tying multiple functions together
